## About TeaLeaf

We are a company located in Japan, the center for green tea production since ancient times. We stand with our name for superior category green tea which is obtained directly from trusted tea farmers directly from Japan. The tea is solely produced by conventional harvesting and traditional processing methods. No middleman, no extra costs for you. All of our teas come from well-known tea farmers and producers. In our store, we almost only have the first tea harvest in spring (First Flush tea) and most of our teas come in limited quantities.

The taste of the pyramid bags is so much nicer than normal tea bags and I can't see me changing my thoughts any time soon. (Dave Bryson)
These lovely products may help you and bring you to another level!! I am having the tea anytime i feel depressed… since I’ve been working from home for a period, these comforting products really can help you out! (Ben Hadley)
TeaLeaf is a life saver! The smell is roof raising. The tin is so attractive on my shelf. And then there is the tea. It has these lovely fruity blackberry tones mixed into the traditional Earl Grey. Tea lovers will appreciate the high quality of these tea bags. (Steve Miller)
